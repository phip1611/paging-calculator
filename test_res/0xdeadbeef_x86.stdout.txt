Page Table Calculator (v0.4.0): x86 32-bit paging
x86 paging uses a 2-level page table. The page is indexed by 12 bits,
which results in a page-size of 4096 bytes. Each page table is indexed by 10
bits and has 2^10 == 1024 entries. Each page-table entry is 32-bit in size.
Hence, a page table occupies the size of a page. Huge pages have a size of
2^22 == 4 MiB.
